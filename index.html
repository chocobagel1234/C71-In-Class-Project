      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited it on dec 2018</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little resturaunt tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the café. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi Café" while you are on the main road. The resturaunt has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can even be shared by 2 people! It attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hip & happening. It also hosts the famous "Prithvi Theater Fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited it in Feb 2019</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place that you <i>must</i> visit! Top tip: Hire a tour guide to understand the stories of a historical site like this that is famous among tourists. The building itself is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls, and it contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras of Indian history. It has a normal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-₹250 for foreigners. Overall, it's a nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

  <p>I watched it today with my friends and we all loved it! ou should have a minimal understanding of the previous story, though, or you will miss out on most of the fun! I'd recommend you to watch Infinity War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron
    Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame because the entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot! I don't want to give you any spoilers, but (spoiler alert!) there is a head dismemberent at the beginning of the movie.
    The movie itself is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series, and it shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. It is lengthly, though, at an impressive 3 hours of film in total to watch. However, it is worthwhile to watch until the end, for the fact that you don't want to miss a  <i>second</i> of this movie!

<p>I took my kids to watch the movie and they loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyoncé really brought Nala to life but Timon and Pumba really stole the show. Kids would love it.</p>
